# mySVN

### Task description

Make a revision control application. It will have at least the following functionalities: registration of users in the system (users may have different rights to the repository), login of a user. If the user is logged in he will be able to perform operations such as: downloading the sources in the repository, adding, deleting files, committing the operation of some changes, the revert operation (on the server will be kept log files that will describe the differences between versions of a file). Bonus: creation of a graphical interface for logs in which commits, changes compared to the previous version can be viewed.
